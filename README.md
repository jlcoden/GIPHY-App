# GIPHY-App

This an animal-themed Giphy application that allows the user to view GIFs of the animal(s) of their choice. 

* Once the page loads there are 12 default animal buttons that the user can click on to see GIFs. 
* In additional to the default buttons, the user can also input a new animal category, which will dynamically generate a GIF button, allowing them to see GIFs of that animal. 
* When a button is clicked, 10 GIFs are populated, and each GIF also displays the GIF rating and title.
* Once the GIFs are displayed, the user can also click on each GIF to animate it, and then click on it again to pause the animation.
